## About us

Every movie has a story. All of us have an opinion to share. So we built a place where you can log all of the movies you consider to be your favorites, rank them based on what appeals to YOU, and write in-depth reviews that will help spark discussions between people who share your passion for film. CineMatch serves aficionados of every kind, from classic summer tentpole enthusiasts to indie Producer's Lunch folk, the self-proclaimed "foreign film expert" with a fresh take on everything contemporary.

## Our Vision

But we go beyond just sharing the movie experience; we want to make sure passionate film lovers connect and try to help each other. By providing features such as forums, discussion boards, and personalized recommendations, we help people join communities surrounded by similar interests, argue over genres, and uncover hidden cinematic treasures together.

Our vision with CineMatch is to gather as many users as possible who share a joint interest: film. CineMatch is our vision for a living ecosystem, powered by the ideas, opinions, and experiences that make our world of visual storytelling so rich. Users will have a more active role in the platform; this is not just an application for content consumption. We want to build a collaborative, open-ended cinematic knowledge base via user reviews, ratings, and discussions.

## Getting Started

To use CineMatch, you need to create an account. Once you have created an account, you can start adding movies to your profile, rate them, write reviews, and connect with other users. You can also follow other users, see their reviews and ratings, and get movie recommendations based on your preferences. We are constantly improving the platform, so if you have any feedback or suggestions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

## Movie Recommender with AI
Our recommender system is built on the idea that the best recommendations come from people who share your interests. We use collaborative filtering to recommend movies based on your ratings! So when you visit our recommender page, you will get a handful of popular movies, where you can rate them, skip them, or add them to your watchlist. After we have gathered enough information, we will provide you with a list of movies that you might like.
